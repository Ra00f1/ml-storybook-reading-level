Every autumn, the birds migrate to Mexico and to southern United States. They navigate with the rotation of the Polaris star of the Ursa Minor constellation (also known as Little Bear). Polaris lies at the end of the bear\u2019s tail and is also known as the North Pole Star. It indicates the direction to the north pole and is always seen in the northern hemisphere. Light pollution from excessive artificial light in urban areas, makes it hard to see stars in the sky at night. This has a negative impact on nature, including obstructing bird migration.
